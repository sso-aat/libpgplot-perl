This package consists of a perl module called PGPLOT. pgplot
is a subroutine library, and PGPLOT is the corresponding perl module.
Try "perldoc PGPLOT" to start learning about it.  ( "man perldoc" for more on
perldoc).  Or try "man PGPLOT" .  Also type "man pgplot" to get documentation
on the FORTRAN and C interfaces to the library, much of which applies to the
perl interface.
