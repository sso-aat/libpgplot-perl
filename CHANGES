- disable calls to pgmtext(!) in tests on FreeBSD

2.26 2021-02-15
- ExtUtils::F77 is not a runtime requirement
- tests no longer ask for device - set the environment var (default /NULL)

2.25 2021-02-13

 - add CONFIGURE_REQUIRES dep - thanks CHORNY for report

2.22 2019-03-17
 - Minor change to Makefile.PL to add link with libpng12,libz (avoids PERL_DL_NONLAZY
   error with SciPDL), and also to search SciPDL directory /Applications/PDL/pgplot
 - fixes to tests to work on Perl 5.26+
 - metadata updates

2.21 2011-01-01
 - Semi-dirty hack in Makefile.PL to force i386/x86_64 single arch only builds on Mac OS X. - Karl
   (for libpgplot compatibility which seems to be generally built this way, e.g. in SciKarl)
   Note added some clever code to try and match the arch of the pgplot binaries.
 - PGPLOT::HANDLE warning fix (Chris Phillips Jun 2010)
 - Make linking order -lcpgplot -lpgplot for cygwin (Chris Marshall Dec 2010)

2.20 2007-05-16
 - Doug Burke's Makefile.PL patch - re-org and better OS X support.
 - Added /usr/local/pgplot to the include search path
 - Added -png to the default list of libs as just about every pgplot build needs this
 - Now works cleanly on Intel and PPC OS X with gcc, g77 and gfortran
 - Added INSTALL, INSTALL-MacOSX and INSTALL-Win32 instruction files and updated README

2.19 2006-01-03
 - Diab's patch to allow specifying alternate libary paths on the command line (see HELP)
 - Added pgpt1 and pgerr1 back for compatibility with latest C PGPLOT
 - Win32 patches from Rob - Sisyphus <kalinabears@iinet.net.au> (2005/1/25)

2.18 2000-12-28
 - Added file HINTS.osf, updated HELP
 - Fixed memory leak in coerce1D (thanks to Pete Ratzlaff)
 - Added Doug Hunt's internals patch to export more pgplot C routines
 - Improvements to HELP file

2.17 2000-05-08
 - Charles Lane's patch to do with new perl versions (PL_XXX stuff)
 - Changed my email address.

2.16 2000-03-10
 - Added function struct to allow access to expose certain PGPLOT
   routines to the outside (currently cpgmove, cpgdraw)

2.15 1999-10-26
 - Fixed Makefile.PL minor problem

2.14 1999-10-15
 - Updated HELP some more.
 - Removed ExtUtils from distribution and made seperate to avoid confusing
   CPAN, is now a PREREQ_PM
 - Removed erroneous reference in PGPLOT.pm (Charles Lane).
 - Added HINTS.irix

2.13 1999-05-14
 - Updates to ExtUtils::F77 (now v1.10) (q.t.) for RedHat 6.0 etc.

2.12 1999-05-11
 - Added PGPLOT_DIR to path for include files.
 - Removed pgpt1 and pgerrb1 left over from old perl4 version - see
   pgcompatbility.p if you still need them.
 - Changed macro names for perl 5.004_53 (Joshua Pritikin
   <joshua.pritikin@db.com>) and inserted a conditional so older perl's
   still work.
 - More ExtUtils::F77 changes (now at v1.09)
 - Small test.pl patch from Chuck Lane <lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu>
 - Fixed error in test12.p

2.11 1998-09-11
 - Added support for PGPLOT_DIR in Makefile.PL, updated HELP.
 - Mentioned 'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=...' in README.
 - More HELP stuff.
 - ExtUtils::F77 v1.08

2.10 1998-05-21
 - Various changes to ExtUtils::F77 q.v.

2.09 1998-02-17
 - Documented xubpp problem in HELP because I got fed up
   with waiting for p5p to fix. No other changes.

2.08 1998-01-07
 - Added improved -lgcc support.
 - PGPLOT version check in test12.p

2.07 1997-09-03
 - Added support for new functions in PGPLOT 5.2.0 library. Note: TK
   driver looks nice but haven't yet implemented this in perl version.
   Presumably can be done with perl/Tk.
 - Extra test12.p for new routines
 - No longer supporting binary versions in any shape or form. Life is too
   short. Get a FORTRAN compiler. :-)
 - Added -lgcc for gcc built perls in ExtUtils::F77

2.06 1997-06-09
 - Important bug fixes to array packing code which is now
   called arrays.{c,h}
 - Added fake MAIN__ symbol to stop annoying bug reports about some
   versions of gcc. :-)
 - arrays.c now supports unsigned chars and shorts. (Thanks Tim!)
 - Additions to HELP and documentation
 - Patches to improve ExtUtils::F77
 - Improvements to tests
 - pgcompatibilty.p (NOT INSTALLED!) defines simple compatibilty
   routines for perl4 pgperl version. This had some gnarly single point
   versions of routines which are now superfluous.

2.02 1997-02-19
 - Made Makefile.PL more clever.
 - Added a file HELP with useful problem fixing information.
 - Fixed some small type cast bugs in kgbpack.c

2.01 1997-01-03
 - No longer providing perl4 version.
 - All the array packing functions reimplemented in C to improve
   speed and robustness.
 - Simplified build procedure - PGPLOT module should now build
   in standard Perl way. (i.e. 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make
   install'). Makefile.PL should not have to be edited and upgrading
   should now be much easier.
 - Added 'pass by reference' convention to allow explicit use of
   pre-packed binary data.
 - Supports pgplot routines up to pgplot v5.1.1.
 - Added POD documentation.
 - FORTRAN link support is now via ExtUtils::F77 module (included).
 - Now providing binaries of pgplot libraries for various
   architectures rather than statically-linked module binaries. This
   should make upgrading easier.
 - Removed special one-point routine versions (hang-over from
   perl4 version).
 - Removed pgplot.pl (again a hang-over from old perl4 version).
 - General tidy up and reorganisation of distribution
